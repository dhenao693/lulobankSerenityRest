# lulobankSerenityRest

- This automation was focused on the happy path of the services, the response of each service is stored in
  "src/main/resources" in a json type file with the name of what is done,

- It is worth noting that the services are very intermittent and there are some that never responded correctly, for which the tests have flaws; but it is the purpose of this project

- There are comments in the validations of the answers to be able to show the correct functioning of the services emulating that they had a correct answer (This is done for practical purposes to be able to present the project)
